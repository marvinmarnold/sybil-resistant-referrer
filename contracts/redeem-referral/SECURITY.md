# Report a security issue

The project team welcomes security reports and is committed to providing prompt attention to
security issues. Security issues should be reported via the public Github Issue tracker.

## Vulnerability coordination

Remediation of security vulnerabilities is prioritized by the project team. The project team
coordinates remediation with third-party project stakeholders via
[Github Security Advisories](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories).
Third-party stakeholders may include the reporter of the issue, affected direct or indirect users of
this project, and maintainers of upstream dependencies if applicable.

## Security advisories

The project team is committed to transparency in the security issue disclosure process. The project
team announces security issues via
[project Github Release notes](https://github.com/wordlcoin/world-id-example-airdrop/releases).
